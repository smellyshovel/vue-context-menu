# I need help

I need help with automated tests. The main reason is the lack of time. The second reason is not good enough instruments for testing. I used to test with Cypress initially, but realised soon that it's impossible due to the fact that Cypress isn't capable of performing right-clicks which, as you can guess, is crucial to test such a plugin.

I switched to Nightwatch then, but its documentation is awful (as well as the API) and it seems too "raw" in general.

So any testing-related contributions are highly welcome.
