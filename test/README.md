# I need help

I need help with automated tests. The main reason is the lack of time. The second reason is not good enough instruments for testing. I used to test with `cypress` initially, but realised soon that it's impossible due to the fact that `cypress` isn't capable of performing right-clicks.

I switched to `nightwatch`, but its documentation is awful and it seems too "raw" in general.

So any testing-related contributions are welcome.
