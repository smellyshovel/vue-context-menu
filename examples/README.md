This is the stand used to test the plugin. It's a Vue + Vue Router project compiled by Webpack and served to [localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080) by Express (using Webpack Dev Middleware and Webpack Hot Middleware).

Start with `$ npm run dev`.

It's also used for automated testing, but the automated testing is not yet fully implemented. Checkout the [`test/` folder's README](https://github.com/smellyshovel/vue-custom-context-menu/blob/v3/test/README.md) for details.
